Task 1: Personal Portfolio Website
The first task involved designing a personal portfolio website that reflects my identity as a budding front-end developer. I built a clean, responsive site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes an introduction section, project gallery, contact form, and links to my social profiles. This task helped me showcase my skills while learning modern web design principles like flexbox, animations, and responsive layouts.
